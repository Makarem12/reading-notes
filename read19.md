# Cryptography
Cryptography is the practice of securing communication and information through the use of codes, so only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. It involves techniques such as encryption (converting information into a secure format), decryption (reverting encrypted information back to its original format), and hashing (transforming data into a fixed-size string of characters). Cryptography is essential for securing data in various domains including online transactions, secure communications, and data protection.

Symmetric Encryption: This method uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It is efficient for large data sets but requires secure key exchange.

1. Asymmetric Encryption: Utilizes a pair of keys - a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This method is crucial for secure key exchanges and digital signatures.

2. Hash Functions: These produce a fixed-size string (hash value) from input data of any size. Hash functions are essential for data integrity verification and are a foundational component in cryptographic systems.

3. Digital Signatures: These provide a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document using asymmetric encryption techniques. They ensure that the sender's identity is verified and the message has not been altered.

# Hashing in Cryptography
Hashing is a cryptographic process that converts an input (or 'message') into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash value. The output appears random and significantly different even with a small change in the input
