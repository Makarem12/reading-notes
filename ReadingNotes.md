## Reading Notes :
*What I read touches on many of my daily activities that I do to improve my level of programming. I feel like I am going backwards and not making much progress. Most likely the reason is due to my method of practice and learning. I must change it*

*The advanced mindset, according to what I have seen, is the qualitative shift that makes a big difference in our lives, our activities and our daily affairs*

## Things I want to know more about :

1. How long does it take to make a difference? Is it time or practice?
